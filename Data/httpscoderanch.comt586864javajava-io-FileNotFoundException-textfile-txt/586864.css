				<title>java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\textfile.txt (Access is denied)</title>
				<description><![CDATA[I think I found the problem.  I checked by trying to save a text file right to that location manually and got a "you don't have permission error".<br /> <br /> You can't save directly to the C drive like that I think.  <br /> <br /> Normally, since most Computers have a Users directory underneath the C drive, yours might not but the chances are high that it does, <br /> <br /> then you would make a new Directory under the users directory, you might be able to just create it programmatically.<br /> <br /> <br /> Anyway, <br /> <br /> try creating it as C:/Users/SomeDirectory/textfile.txt<br /> <br /> <br /> At the very least, you need a subdirectory underneath C.  You can't just save something as a file itself to the C drive itself.<br /> <br /> Sorry, scratch that, normally under the Users directory, you have a directoy that is your computer name.  I wouldn't know what yours is.  <br /> <br /> so it's<br /> <br /> C:/Users/YourComputerName/textfile.txt<br /> <br /> that will work.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Yes, I did that and it works. Is there a way of making our code "create new files/folders as an administrator" ?<br /> <br /> Thanks <img src="https://www.coderanch.com/images/smilies/3b63d1616c5dfcf29f8a7a031aaa7cad.gif" />]]></description>
